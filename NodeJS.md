Sure! Here's an in-depth explanation of all the questions you asked:

---

### 1. **Node.js Basics:**

- **What is Node.js, and how is it different from traditional web server technologies like Apache or IIS?**
  
  Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, using Chrome's V8 engine. Unlike traditional web servers like Apache or IIS, which are multithreaded, Node.js operates on a single-threaded, non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it lightweight and efficient for handling many concurrent connections. It's particularly suited for I/O-heavy tasks (such as reading/writing files or querying databases) rather than CPU-intensive tasks.

---

- **What is event-driven programming in Node.js? How does the event loop work?**
  
  Event-driven programming is a paradigm where the flow of a program is determined by events such as user actions (clicks, typing) or messages from other programs. In Node.js, the event loop is a mechanism that continuously checks for and processes events (such as I/O tasks) in a queue. Node.js handles long-running tasks asynchronously, allowing the event loop to process other tasks while waiting for the long-running task to complete.

---

- **Explain the concept of non-blocking I/O. Why is it important in Node.js?**
  
  Non-blocking I/O refers to performing I/O operations (like reading files or querying databases) asynchronously, meaning that the program doesn’t wait for these operations to finish before moving on to the next task. This is crucial in Node.js because it allows the server to handle many requests simultaneously without being slowed down by time-consuming I/O operations, thus increasing performance and scalability.

### 2. **Modules & NPM:**

- **What is the difference between `require` and `import` in Node.js?**
  
  - `require`: The CommonJS module syntax, used to import modules in Node.js (e.g., `const fs = require('fs');`). It loads modules synchronously.
  - `import`: The ES6 module syntax, now supported in newer versions of Node.js. It's more modern and can be used to import modules asynchronously (e.g., `import fs from 'fs';`). 

CommonJS (`require`) is backward-compatible, but ES6 modules (`import/export`) are the future of JavaScript module systems.

---

- **How would you create a simple custom module in Node.js?**

```js
// myModule.js
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

module.exports = greet;

// app.js
const greet = require('./myModule');
console.log(greet('Abhishek'));  // Output: Hello, Abhishek!
```

---

- **What is the role of the `package.json` file? What are `dependencies` and `devDependencies`?**

  - `package.json`: This file contains metadata about your Node.js project, such as the project name, version, author, and the list of dependencies. It is used by npm to manage package installations and configurations.
  - `dependencies`: Packages required to run the application (e.g., Express, Mongoose).
  - `devDependencies`: Packages only needed for development purposes (e.g., testing libraries like Mocha or linters like ESLint).

---

### 3. **Asynchronous Programming:**

- **What are callbacks, promises, and async/await in Node.js? Can you explain their differences and show examples of how they’re used?**

  - **Callbacks**: A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later.

    ```js
    fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(data.toString());
    });
    ```

  - **Promises**: A more structured way to handle async code. They represent a value that will be available at some point in the future.

    ```js
    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
            if (err) reject(err);
            resolve(data);
        });
    });

    promise.then(data => console.log(data.toString())).catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```

  - **Async/Await**: Built on top of promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous.

    ```js
    async function readFile() {
        try {
            const data = await fs.promises.readFile('file.txt');
            console.log(data.toString());
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
    }
    ```

---

- **What are "callback hell" and "promise chaining"? How do you handle them in real-world applications?**

  - **Callback Hell**: When multiple asynchronous operations are nested inside each other, resulting in deeply nested callbacks, making code hard to read and maintain.
    
    Example of callback hell:

    ```js
    asyncOperation1(() => {
        asyncOperation2(() => {
            asyncOperation3(() => {
                // and so on...
            });
        });
    });
    ```

  - **Promise Chaining**: With promises, you can chain `.then()` methods to avoid nesting.

    ```js
    asyncOperation1()
        .then(result1 => asyncOperation2(result1))
        .then(result2 => asyncOperation3(result2))
        .catch(err => console.error(err));
    ```

  - **Solution**: Using **async/await** makes code easier to understand.

    ```js
    async function handleOperations() {
        try {
            const result1 = await asyncOperation1();
            const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
            const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
    }
    ```

### 4. **Express.js:**

- **How do you set up an Express.js server and define routes?**

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello, World!');
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Server running on port 3000');
    });
    ```

---

- **What is middleware in Express, and how would you create a custom middleware?**

  Middleware is a function that has access to the request object, response object, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.

  Custom middleware example:

    ```js
    function logger(req, res, next) {
        console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
        next();
    }

    app.use(logger);  // Apply middleware globally
    ```

---

- **Can you explain how error handling works in Express?**

  Error-handling middleware must have 4 parameters: `err, req, res, next`.

    ```js
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        console.error(err.stack);
        res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
    });
    ```

---

- **How would you handle file uploads and serve static files in an Express application?**

  - For file uploads, use the **multer** package.

    ```js
    const multer = require('multer');
    const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

    app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
        res.send('File uploaded successfully');
    });
    ```

  - To serve static files:

    ```js
    app.use(express.static('public'));
    ```

---

### 5. **Databases:**

- **How do you connect Node.js with databases like MongoDB or MySQL?**

  For **MongoDB**, using **Mongoose**:

    ```js
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
    ```

  For **MySQL**, using **mysql2**:

    ```js
    const mysql = require('mysql2');
    const connection = mysql.createConnection({ host: 'localhost', user: 'root', database: 'test' });
    connection.query('SELECT * FROM users', (err, results) => {
        console.log(results);
    });
    ```

---

- **How would you handle database transactions in Node.js?**

  In MySQL, transactions can be handled like this:

    ```js
    connection.beginTransaction(err => {
        if (err) throw err;

        connection.query('INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)', ['John'], (err, result) => {
            if (err) return connection.rollback(() => { throw err; });

            connection.commit(err => {
                if (err) return connection.rollback(() => { throw err; });
                console.log('Transaction complete');
            });
        });
    });
    ```

---

- **What are some ways to optimize database queries in Node.js?**
  
  - Use indexes for frequently queried fields.
  - Avoid N+1 queries by fetching related data in a single query.
  - Cache results of frequently run queries (e.g., using Redis).
  - Use connection pooling to reduce overhead of establishing database connections.

### 6. **Security in Node.js:**

- **What are some security best practices for a Node.js application?**
  - Validate and sanitize user inputs to avoid SQL injection and other attacks.
  - Use HTTPS to encrypt data between client and server.
  - Implement rate-limiting to prevent DDoS attacks.
  - Regularly update dependencies to avoid security vulnerabilities.

---

- **How would you protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF in a Node.js application?**

  - **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries
